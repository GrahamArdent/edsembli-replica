The Edsembli Student Information System (SIS) is a cloud-based platform used by many Ontario school boards to centralize student achievement data and generate official provincial report cards.11 The platform is designed to align with the Ontario Ministry of Education’s "Growing Success" policy and supports elementary, secondary, and Kindergarten reporting.23

### **Software Format and Coverage**

* **Web-Based Interface:** The software is accessed via a web browser, allowing teachers to manage student records and input grades from any device with an internet connection.
* **"Live Form" Editing:** One of the platform's key features is "Live Form" editing. This allows teachers to work on a digital version of the report card that looks exactly like the final printed document.3 This eliminates the need for manual line counting or guessing if text will fit within the allocated space.3

* **Coverage:** The system tracks attendance (days absent and times late), subject-specific grades, anecdotal comments, and specialized learning skills.3

### **Content and Requirements by Grade Level**

The fields and reporting requirements change significantly based on the student's grade level:

* **Kindergarten (Communication of Learning):**
  * **Structure:** Reporting is entirely anecdotal and organized into the "Four Frames": Belonging and Contributing, Self-Regulation and Well-Being, Demonstrating Literacy and Mathematics Behaviours, and Problem Solving and Innovating.
  * **Required Content:** For each frame, teachers must provide comments covering **Key Learning**, **Growth in Learning**, and **Next Steps in Learning**.
  * **Collaboration:** Teachers and Early Childhood Educators (ECEs) are expected to collaborate on observations, though the teacher is the final author and signer.
* **Grades 1–8 (Elementary Provincial Report Card):**
  * **Fields:** Includes letter grades (A through D and R) and anecdotal comments for each subject.4
  * **Learning Skills:** Evaluates six specific areas: Responsibility, Organization, Independent Work, Collaboration, Initiative, and Self-Regulation using a scale of E (Excellent), G (Good), S (Satisfactory), and N (Needs Improvement).
* **Grades 9–12 (Secondary Provincial Report Card):**
  * **Fields:** Reports achievement as percentage marks.
  * **Weighting:** Generally follows a formula where 70% of the grade is based on coursework and 30% is based on a final evaluation (exam, project, or culminating task).

### **Required vs. Optional Fields**

* **Required Fields:** Every report card requires the student’s Ontario Education Number (OEN), attendance data, and signatures from the teacher and principal.
* **Special Program Checkboxes:** Mandatory indicators must be checked if a student is on an Individual Education Plan (IEP), is an English Language Learner (ESL/ELD), or is in a French immersion/core program.5
* **Optional/Flexible Fields:** Teachers have professional judgment over the depth of their anecdotal comments. While a minimum of three sentences is typically required for Kindergarten frame comments, teachers are not required to fill the entire comment box.

### **Character and Space Limits**

* **Visual Boundaries:** Rather than a strict "character count," limits are primarily determined by the physical dimensions of the comment box on the report card.
* **Configurable Parameters:** Administrators can set specific font styles, font sizes (12pt is suggested for legibility), and the width/height of the comment boxes at the board level.6
* **Comment Banks:** To manage these limits efficiently, teachers often use "Comment Banks."7 These are pre-written phrases (provided by the board, school, or individual teacher) that can be inserted and then personalized with student names or gender-specific pronouns (e.g., using placeholders like {Name} or {He/She}).

### **Parent Access and Expectations**

* **Edsembli Connect (Parent Portal):** Parents access digital report cards, IEPs, and attendance through a secure online portal.8
* **Communication Standards:** Reports must use "plain language" and avoid technical jargon (often called "edu-babble") to ensure parents clearly understand their child's strengths and areas for growth.
* **Response Times:** School boards typically expect teachers or administrators to respond to parent concerns or questions within two business days.
* **Catholic Integration:** In Catholic boards, reports often include reflections on Religious and Family Life Education, connecting student growth to Catholic Graduate Expectations and faith-based values.

### **Useful Considerations for Educators**

* **Audit Logs:** The system maintains audit logs of who has accessed or changed student records to comply with privacy laws like PHIPA and MFIPPA.4

* **Digital Verification:** Boards are increasingly using the system to replace the "September paper flood," allowing parents to verify and update contact/medical information digitally.
* **Batch Actions:** To save time, teachers can apply the same comment or grade to an entire group of students with a single click and then customize individual entries as needed.3
