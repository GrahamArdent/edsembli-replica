# VGReport Engine - Minimal Dependencies for Sidecar Build
# This file contains ONLY the packages required for the desktop sidecar.
# Heavy analytics dependencies (pandas, pyarrow, duckdb) are EXCLUDED
# to keep the PyInstaller bundle under 50MB.

# Core engine dependencies
ruamel.yaml>=0.18.0          # YAML parsing for templates
pydantic>=2.6                # Data validation (used for JSON Schema generation)

# Text processing
textstat>=0.7.3              # Readability metrics

# CLI (optional - only if sidecar exposes CLI interface)
# typer>=0.9.0
# rich>=13.0.0

# Note: The full requirements.in includes pandas, pyarrow, and duckdb
# for data analysis features. These are NOT needed for report generation
# and should be excluded from the sidecar build to minimize size.
