# Evidence Pattern: Sand and Water Exploration

## Context
Children exploring at sand and water tables (pouring, measuring, building, experimenting).

## Observable Behaviors (Signals)

| Indicator | Behaviors |
|-----------|-----------|
| `indicator.problem_solving.inquiry` | Testing properties, asking "what if" questions, observing cause/effect. |
| `indicator.literacy_math.numeracy` | Measuring, comparing quantities, using math language (more, less, full, empty). |

## Teacher Moves (Prompts)
- "What happens when you pour it faster?"
- "Which container holds more? How could you find out?"
- "What did you discover about the sand today?"

## Sample Observation Note (Template)
