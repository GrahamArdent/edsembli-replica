| `indicator.belonging.relationships` | Listening to others' perspectives, compromising, seeking adult help appropriately. |

## Teacher Moves (Prompts)
- "What happened? How did that make you feel?"
- "What could you say to let them know what you need?"
- "What's a solution that works for both of you?"
