# Evidence Pattern: Cooperative Block Play

## Context
Children working together in the block area to construct a shared structure (tower, city, road).

## Observable Behaviors (Signals)

| Indicator | Behaviors |
|-----------|-----------|
| `indicator.belonging.relationships` | Negotiating roles (builder, architect), sharing blocks, taking turns placing pieces. |
| `indicator.belonging.community` | Respecting others' space, cleaning up together, celebrating shared success. |
| `indicator.problem_solving.innovation` | Using blocks in novel ways, solving structural stability problems together. |

## Teacher Moves (Prompts)
- "How did you decide who would put that block there?"
- "What suggests to you that this tower is stable?"
- "I noticed you helped {child} find a long block. How did that help the building?"

## Sample Observation Note (Template)
> {child} joined a group building a [structure type]. {pronoun_subject} negotiated a role by [action/words]. When the structure fell, {pronoun_subject} [reaction/strategy].
