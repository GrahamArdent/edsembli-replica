# Evidence Pattern: Construction and Building

## Context
Children building structures using various materials (LEGO, magnetic tiles, cardboard, loose parts).

## Observable Behaviors (Signals)

| Indicator | Behaviors |
|-----------|-----------|
| `indicator.problem_solving.innovation` | Planning before building, revising when structures fail, testing stability. |
| `indicator.problem_solving.creativity` | Creating original designs, combining materials, representing ideas in 3D. |
| `indicator.self_regulation.attention` | Persisting through challenges, returning to projects over multiple days. |

## Teacher Moves (Prompts)
- "What are you planning to build?"
- "What happened when it fell? What will you try differently?"
- "How did you figure that out?"

## Sample Observation Note (Template)
> {child} built a [structure] using [materials]. {pronoun_subject} demonstrated {skill} when {challenge/action}. {pronoun_subject} persisted by {persistence_evidence}.
