# Evidence Patterns

This folder contains **Evidence Patterns** ($evidence.pattern.*$).

## What is an Evidence Pattern?

An Evidence Pattern is a reusable, non-PII archetype of a learning scenario. It serves as a limit or structure for documenting observations without storing actual student data.

## Structure

Each evidence pattern file (YAML or Markdown) defines:
- The context (e.g., Block Area, Snack Time)
- Observable behaviors linked to specific Frames/Indicators
- Teacher moves/prompts

## Status

*Currently empty. See `examples/evidence-pattern-sample.md` for the proposed structure.*
