# Audits

This folder contains periodic repository audits (snapshots of structure, validation status, coverage, drift risks, and gaps).

## Conventions

- One file per audit, named `audit.YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Audits are design artifacts and must contain no PII.
- Prefer referencing canonical IDs and file paths rather than copying large content blocks.

## Latest

- [audit.2026-01-11.md](audit.2026-01-11.md)
