# Evidence Pattern: Math Manipulatives Exploration

## Context
Children working with math materials (counters, pattern blocks, links, cubes, scales).

## Observable Behaviors (Signals)

| Indicator | Behaviors |
|-----------|-----------|
| `indicator.literacy_math.numeracy` | Counting with one-to-one correspondence, comparing quantities, creating patterns, sorting by attribute. |
| `indicator.problem_solving.inquiry` | Testing ideas, making predictions, explaining reasoning. |

## Teacher Moves (Prompts)
- "How many do you have? How do you know?"
- "What comes next in your pattern?"
- "How are these the same? How are they different?"

## Sample Observation Note (Template)
> {child} used [manipulative] to [activity]. {pronoun_subject} demonstrated understanding of {concept} by {evidence}. When asked to explain, {pronoun_subject} said "{quote}".
