# Comment Style Guide (CoL Narrative)

This guide defines the style and constraints for Communication of Learning (CoL) narrative comments.

## Core goals

- Parent-friendly: clear, concrete, jargon-light language
- Strength-based: focus on what the child can do and is learning
- Evidence-grounded: anchor claims in observable behaviours
- Actionable next steps: specific and achievable

## Structure by section

### Key Learning (`key_learning`)

Include:
- What learning is currently emerging/developing
- One or two concrete evidence signals

Avoid:
- Deficit framing (“cannot”, “fails to”) unless required and phrased neutrally

### Growth (`growth`)

Include:
- A clear comparison (“now… whereas previously…”) grounded in evidence

Avoid:
- Ranking/comparing to peers

### Next Steps (`next_steps`)

Include:
- A single focused goal
- A school strategy and a home strategy

Avoid:
- Vague goals (“keep practicing”) without specifying what and how

## Slot placeholders (required)

All templates must use `{slot}` placeholders (not names). Recommended slots:
- `{child}`
- `{pronoun_subject}` / `{pronoun_possessive}`
- `{strength}`
- `{evidence}`
- `{change}` / `{previous}` (for growth)
- `{goal}` / `{school_strategy}` / `{home_strategy}` (for next steps)

## Language rules

- Use plain language and short sentences.
- Prefer observable verbs: “noticed”, “shared”, “explained”, “built”, “sorted”, “asked”, “persisted”.
- Avoid judgment words: “lazy”, “bad”, “immature”, “manipulative”.

## Length and formatting

- Aim for 2–4 sentences per section.
- Avoid lists inside report-card comments unless your SIS formatting supports them.
- Avoid all-caps emphasis.

## Banned / discouraged phrases

Discouraged (replace with observable language):
- “needs improvement” → “is working on…” + evidence + next step
- “struggles with” → “is developing…” + evidence + support strategy

## Tone options (optional taxonomy)

If you later tag templates by tone, consider:
- `parent_friendly`
- `formal`
- `concise`

## Accessibility

- Prefer concrete nouns and verbs over abstractions.
- Avoid acronyms unless defined.
