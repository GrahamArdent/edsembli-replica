# ONSIS (Ontario Student Information System)

## Summary

ONSIS is the Ontario Ministry of Education’s system for collecting student-related reporting data used for accountability and funding purposes.

## Relevance to this framework

- Reinforces why real student data must remain outside the canonical framework repository
- Provides context for SIS data flows and compliance constraints

## Constraints

- Standards and reporting requirements are governed externally
- This repository stores no ONSIS data and does not implement integrations
